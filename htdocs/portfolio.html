			<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>			
			
			<p>The majority of my portfolio samples are from my most recent place of employment, The Center For Advanced Medicine And Surgery. They are a multi-specialty
			medical and out-patient surgical facility located in the north side of Chicago. Prior to my employment, there was no in-house technical communicator or graphic designer. This 
			enabled me to exercise my creative designing, technical writing and communication, and editing skills. </p>
			
		<h3>BROCHURE</h3>
		
		<p>
			This brochure was designed for the center's new In vitro Fertilization (IVF) lab. I collaborated with the lab's manager regarding content, design, and layout. 
			It is currently available on the company's website at <a href="http://www.cntradvancedmed.com/services_advanced_institute_for_infertility.html"> www.cntradvancedmed.com.</a>  </p>

			<p>The brochure below was designed for a neurological surgeon who wanted to educate his patients on his most commonly performed procedures. </p>
			<img src="Images/Malek1.png" alt="Malek" />
			

			<p>This brochure was designed for the rehabilitation office. This office specializes in workers' compensation cases and experiences
			a high volume of patients.  </p>

			<p>Dr. Thill is a Chiropractor who treats patients at more than one office. He wanted to develop his client base and asked that I develop a brochure from several of his personal flyers. </p>

			<p>Designing a brochure for Trail's End, a fictitious horse farm, was an assignment for my Document Design course. The brochure was mentioned as one of the top 3 in the class. </p>

				<h4>BUSINESS CARD</h4>
				<p>The medical center was undergoing a major branding overhaul and campaign, which allowed me to develop new business cards for all of their doctorsâ€”below is a sample. </p>

				<h4>FLYER</h4>
				<p>The center's occupational health division holds in-house seminars throughout the year and mails flyers to new and existing clients. In addition to mailing these
				flyers, they are also sent as an e-blast.  </p>
				<img src="Images/flyer.png"  alt="flyer"/>
	
				<h4>LOGO</h4>
				<p>Creating the logo for the company kick-started the branding campaign. Because the center is both a multi-specialty medical and surgical facility, I 
				decided to incorporate the medical symbol, the caduceus, against a globe, to represent community. I changed the staff to a scalpel and the serpents to a stethoscope.
					The owner very much wanted people to understand his desire to help all communities. </p>

				<h4>NEWSPAPER AD</h4>
				<p> Below are a few of the advertisements I designed for several newspapers. I worked in conjunction with the owner of the facility and external graphic designers. </p>

				<h4>POSTCARD</h4>
				<p>Designing and sending monthly postcards was an additional responsibility I assumed. Below is a postcard sent directly to Chicagoland
				medical specialists. </p>
				<img src="Images/cancer.png" alt="cancer"/>
		
		
				<h4>Mini Booklet</h4>
				<p> This mini booklet was the first all-inclusive advertisement that summarized all of the company's divisions: diagnostic, medical, and surgical. </p>
					<img src="Images/cams.png" alt="cams"/>
				
				<h4>WEBSITE</h4>
				<p> Prior to my employment, the company had a very small website that had no online traffic; today, the company maintains two websites. Gathering content with the doctors, writing, editing, taking pictures, and working closely 
				with the web developers were a few of the responsibilities I managed. With the help of a Search Engine Optimization and Tracking campaign, the sites now have web presence. </p>
